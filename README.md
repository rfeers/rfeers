### Hi there, I am Josep Ferrer 👋

I am a Data Scientist and technical writer from Barcelona 🌊
I love working with data and firmly believe in AI's power to enhance people's lives. 
So... I want to share my passion with others and guide them into this vast field through writing and teaching. 

You can find my project and previous work here:
